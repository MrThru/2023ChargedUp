/**
 * This class serves to coordinate movements between the various subsystems
 * (vertical elevator, horizontal elevator, shoulder, and wrist).
 * 
 * Each method in this class corresponds to one final position that the
 * superstructure can be asked to reach. Each method analyzes the superstructure's
 * current position and choreographs a series of movements (expressed as a
 * Request) that will get the Superstructure to its desired state in a safe
 * manner. Any choreography should abide by these three main constraints:
 * 
 * 1. The wrist should not collide with the ground, bumper, or top of the elevator
 * at any point throughout its travel.
 * 
 * 2. Similarly, the shoulder should not collide with the ground, bumper, or top
 * of the elevator at any point throughout its travel.
 * 
 * 3. Outward extension of the shoulder should be minimized when it is traveling
 * in the range of [-90deg, 90deg].
